Small shell-script to read the current values from a Kostal-Piko&reg; Solar Inverter.
It runs in a continuous loop & publishes the vals to an MQTT-Broker every 30 secs.
Thanks go to [Piko-Stats](https://sourceforge.net/projects/piko/) by [romualddufour](https://sourceforge.net/u/romualddufour/) who created a Python tools to talk to the Kostal-Piko. Most of the info I needed to talk to the Piko from the shell I pulled out of that code.
